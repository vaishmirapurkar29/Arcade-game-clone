# Arcade-game-clone

This is a clone of the classic frogger game achieved using object-oriented JavaScript, HTML5 canvas and CSS3. 

The game involves a player and enemy bugs. Basic functionality involves the player dodging the enemies to reach the river and winning the game.
On the way, the player has to collect stars to boost his score. If he hits a rock, his score goes down. 

The player selection functionality will soon be implemented, which will allow the user to select from a list of 6 players.
